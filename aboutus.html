            <p style="text-align:center;"><i>My name is</i>Aashish Singh. I am a Bachelor in <b>Computer Application</b>. Everyone can agree that I am a<b>good student</b>and that <i>I like to study.</i> I love doing <b>rogramming and Video Editing</b><br>. I am going to enter the <em>university</em> because my goal is to become best version of me  in future and to become a respected professional in one of the fields.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;">I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things.<br>I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Meeting new people who support all my efforts to <b>grow and develop my skills</b> not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surround me now <br>I met on the street while doing my hobby. Iâ€™m in love with photography, so the thing I love doing so much became even more enjoyable. I decided to take beautiful pictures of accidental people<br> and share these photos with them by emails or in social media. I feel <b>happiness</b> inside seeing how happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or sitting somewhere in the park. <br>In this way,<i>Prakhar</i> became my best friend and we both believe that we meant to meet because she studies the same classes and we have similar life goals. </p>
